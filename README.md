1. Get Block Info

    Endpoint: /api/v1/block/{block_number}
    Description: Retrieve detailed information about a specific block (e.g., block number, timestamp, transaction count).
    Example Request: GET /api/v1/block/123456

2. Transfer Token

    Endpoint: /api/v1/transfer
    Description: Transfer tokens on the Arbitrum network. Requires signing with a private key.
    Request Example: POST /api/v1/transfer

{
  "from": "0xYourAddressHere",
  "to": "0xReceiverAddressHere",
  "amount": "10",
  "token": "0xTokenAddressHere",
  "private_key": "0xYourPrivateKeyHere"
}

Response Example:

    {
      "status": "success",
      "transactionHash": "0xabc123...xyz"
    }

3. Transfer via Mnemonic

    Endpoint: /api/v1/transfer-mnemonic
    Description: Send tokens using a mnemonic phrase for wallet recovery and transaction signing.
    Request Example:

    {
      "mnemonic": "pencil apple river music dolphin mirror lantern wave tiger ocean puzzle",
      "to": "0xReceiverAddressHere",
      "amount": "10",
      "token": "0xTokenAddressHere"
    }

4. Get Token Balance

    Endpoint: /api/v1/token-balance
    Description: Get the balance of a specific token for a given address.
    Request Example: GET /api/v1/token-balance?address=0xYourAddressHere&token=0xTokenAddressHere

5. Get Transaction History

    Endpoint: /api/v1/transactions
    Description: Retrieve the transaction history for an address.
    Request Example: GET /api/v1/transactions?address=0xYourAddressHere

6. Get Gas Price

    Endpoint: /api/v1/gas-price
    Description: Fetch the current gas price on the Arbitrum network.
    Request Example: GET /api/v1/gas-price

7. Deploy Smart Contract

    Endpoint: /api/v1/deploy-contract
    Description: Deploy a smart contract to the Arbitrum network.
    Request Example:

    {
      "from": "0xYourAddressHere",
      "bytecode": "0xYourContractBytecodeHere",
      "private_key": "0xYourPrivateKeyHere"
    }

Integration Examples

You've provided several integration examples that cover common scenarios for interacting with the Arbitrum network. These examples include code snippets for:

    Token Transfers (using Web3.js, Web3.py)
    ERC-20 Token Transfers
    Smart Contract Deployments
    Token Swaps (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1inch, Matcha)

Key Highlights

    No Rate Limits: Your service does not impose request limits, which is ideal for high-demand applications.
    Token Transfer & Smart Contract Interaction: The API supports essential functions like token transfers, contract interactions, and contract deployments.
    Mnemonic Support: Allows users to sign transactions without needing a private key directly, useful for account recovery.
    Gas Price and Transaction Monitoring: Real-time gas prices and transaction status can help users optimize their transactions.
    Transaction History: Provides detailed insights into past transactions, useful for debugging or auditing.

Things to Keep in Mind

    Security: Since the API supports private key and mnemonic phrase-based authentication, you must emphasize best practices for securely handling sensitive information (e.g., never expose private keys in public repositories).
    Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling is in place for scenarios like network failures, invalid parameters, or insufficient gas.
    Scalability: While there are no rate limits, ensuring your infrastructure can handle the traffic and computational load is important for scaling large applications.

This API can be a solid foundation for building Web3 applications on Arbitrum, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), wallets, or blockchain explorers. It provides developers with the necessary tools to create highly functional and scalable decentralized applications with Arbitrum's Layer 2 solutions.
